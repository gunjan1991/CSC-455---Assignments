"""
1 (b).	Use python to download from the web and save to a local text file (not into database yet) at least 500,000 
lines worth of tweets. Test your code with fewer rows first â€“ you can reduce the number of tweets if your computer 
is running too slow to handle 500K tweets in a reasonable time. How long did it take to save?
NOTE: Do NOT call read() or readlines() without any parameters. That command will attempt to read the entire file 
and you only need 500K rows.
